This project is on object oriented designs. The scenario given is that a library is considering letting patrons check out electonic
devices. They have commissioned students to create a prototype of a device management and checkout system. Each device has a name, 
Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) code, and availability. The SKU code is an alphanumeric code up to 6 letters in length. There are 5 devices 
preloaded in the system.

There is a main menu that presents the user with 7 options: list devices by title, add new devices, edit device information, search
by device name, check out devices, check in devices, and exit. If you choose option 1 - list devices by title, you will see a list
of all the devices and their information. You are then automatically prompted to choose another option in the menu. When you
choose option 2 - add new devices, you will be prompted to enter a device name and SKU code. Once you press enter, the device will
be added to the library, and the new list of devices will be shown. Option 3 - edit device information prompts you to enter the 
device number you wish to edit. Then, you can change the device name and SKU code and the new list of devices will be shown. 
Option 4 - search by device name, allows you to type in a partial name and the program will run a case insensitive search for the 
device and display any results. Option 5 and 6, check out and in devices, will prompt you to enter a device number and will change
the availability of that device, and display the new list of devices on the screen. Option 7 - exit, allows the user the terminate
the program.
